## Chapter - 1: The onboarding experience 

### Onboarding
Onboarding customers is a process through which new customers "acquire" necessary knowledge and skills to become a part of the application or service

### 4 forces of onboarding

#### Push 
Users find new products due to problems in existing one
##### Be aware of pain points users face in existing product

#### Pull
Users are drawn towards your product and what can be achieved with it 
##### 1. Tailor onboarding process for each stakeholder
##### 2. Explain the benefit of each onboarding task

#### Inertia 
Resistance to change and moving to newer products
##### 1. Provide guidance for complicated tasks
##### 2. Provide simple choices

#### Anxiety
Fear of moving to a new environment
##### 1. Reassure/allow to skip onboarding tasks that are highly "public"
##### 2. Shorten path to success for complex products

###### Note: The best type of onboarding is where users experience a _"successful moment"_

### The different generations of onboarding

#### Onboarding 1.0: Helpful interfaces
Included tooltips and menus 
##### Problem: Tooltips can't be effective when the focus on the product features and not on user needs

#### Onboarding 2.0: Progress bars
Focus on gamification
##### Problem: Works well for small products, not for complex products which can result in force-feeding configuration options. The goal is to benefit users, not businesses

#### Onboading 3.0: Understanding customers' definition of success
Goal is to continually ask users questions when they sign up (chat bots, etc)
##### Benefits
* Learn users' goals
    * Functional goals (Organize my team's tasks)
    * Personal goals (Feel in control of things)
    * Social goals (Impress my boss)
* Users not only set up their account, but also learn to use the app

### Onboarding customers for success

1. Understand the different jobs your product is hired for
2. Understand what success looks like for each job
3. Design paths that guides users through the features that help them achieve success
4. Communicate with users to help them get there
5. Have an early warning system for new users

### CARE - Customer Onboarding Framework

#### 3 components of successful onboarding

##### UI design patterns
*Goal:* guide users through a series of meaningful steps(in whatever suits them the best - gamification, progressive disclosure, product tours, audio guidance, one-time tutorials, etc) that helps them achieve their goal
##### Contextual content
*Goal:* The quality of WHERE and HOW a customer encounters content is as important as the content itself.
##### Contextual communication
*Goal:* Contextual in-app messages are a powerful driving force for onboaring progress but should only be used as a supporting function and should not be over-relied on

#### CARE model of onboarding

##### C - Convert trialists to paying customers
##### A - Activate newly paying customers by guiding them through features that will show them product value
##### R - Retain paying customers - don't wait until someone has stopped using the product to introduce changes
##### E - Expand their usage - Upsell, or cross-sell (Upsell - upgrade plan, cross-sell - sell complimentary products)


### Importance of stories in onboarding process
Stories not only help to identify what "success" means to users, but also help to understand the reasons behind users' push and pull forces

#### Create narrative for user's journey

##### Bad narratives focus on the product, Great narratives focus on the users' needs
To build a compelling narrative, it is important to learn about customers' journey and jobs-to-be-done

### 6 elements of an effective onboarding flow

##### 1. A welcome message
Make users feel valued and recognized

##### 2. An identity for the product or company
Build an understanding of how your users should consider the experience of interacting with your product

##### 3. Problem(s) to be solved
Creates strong connection with users because they see themselves reflected in it

##### 4. At least one explicit value proposal
The promise made by the company - sets clear expectation for what users will get out of the product

##### 5. The mechanics of using the product
Walks users through the product

##### 6. At least one CTA
Don't stop at explaining the product. Prompt the user to use it.
