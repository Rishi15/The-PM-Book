Elevate products from a comprehensive list of chapters, collected in the form of notes from various sources

## Chapter - 1: The onboarding experience 

### Onboarding
Onboarding customers is a process through which new customers "acquire" necessary knowledge and skills to become a part of the application or service

### 4 forces of onboarding

#### Push 
Users find new products due to problems in existing one
##### Be aware of pain points users face in existing product

#### Pull
Users are drawn towards your product and what can be achieved with it 
##### 1. Tailor onboarding process for each stakeholder
##### 2. Explain the benefit of each onboarding task

#### Inertia 
Resistance to change and moving to newer products
##### 1. Provide guidance for complicated tasks
##### 2. Provide simple choices

#### Anxiety
Fear of moving to a new environment
##### 1. Reassure/allow to skip onboarding tasks that are highly "public"
##### 2. Shorten path to success for complex products

### The different generations of onboarding
#### Onboarding 1.0: Helpful interfaces
Included tooltips and menus 
##### Problem: Tooltips can't be effective when the focus on the product features and not on user needs

#### Onboarding 2.0: Progress bars
Focus on gamification
##### Problem: Works well for small products, not for complex products which can result in force-feeding configuration options. The goal is to benefit users, not businesses

#### Onboading 3.0: Understanding customers' definition of success
Goal is to continually ask users questions when they sign up (chat bots, etc)
##### Benefits
* Learn users' goals
    * Functional goals (Organize my team's tasks)
    * Personal goals (Feel in control of things)
    * Social goals (Impress my boss)
* Users not only set up their account, but also learn to use the app

### Onboarding customers for success
1. Understand the different jobs your product is hired for
2. Understand what success looks like for each job
3. Design paths that guides users through the features that help them achieve success
4. Communicate with users to help them get there
5. Have an early warning system for new users

### 6 elements of an effective onboarding flow

##### 1. A welcome message
Make users feel valued and recognized

##### 2. An identity for the product or company
Build an understanding of how your users should consider the experience of interacting with your product

##### 3. Problem(s) to be solved
Creates strong connection with users because they see themselves reflected in it

##### 4. At least one explicit value proposal
The promise made by the company - sets clear expectation for what users will get out of the product

##### 5. The mechanics of using the product
Walks users through the product

##### 6. At least one CTA
Don't stop at explaining the product. Prompt the user to use it.

### 3 components of successful onboarding

##### UI design patterns
*Goal:* guide users through a series of meaningful steps(in whatever suits them the best - gamification, progressive disclosure, product tours, audio guidance, one-time tutorials, etc) that helps them achieve their goal
##### Contextual content
*Goal:* The quality of WHERE and HOW a customer encounters content is as important as the content itself.
##### Contextual communication
*Goal:* Contextual in-app messages are a powerful driving force for onboaring progress but should only be used as a supporting function and should not be over-relied on


### CARE - Customer Onboarding Framework

*C* - Convert trialists to paying customers
*A* - Activate newly paying customers by guiding them through features that will show them product value
*R* - Retain paying customers - don't wait until someone has stopped using the product to introduce changes
*E* - Expand their usage - Upsell, or cross-sell (Upsell - upgrade plan, cross-sell - sell complimentary products)

#### Stories in onboarding
Stories not only help to identify what "success" means to users, but also help to understand the reasons behind users' push and pull forces
*Bad narratives focus on the product, Great narratives focus on the users' needs*
To build a compelling narrative, it is important to learn about customers' journey and jobs-to-be-done

### Hooking trial users

1. Focus on jobs customers want to do - The first use experience should help the user solve the problem for which he is using the product
2. Show, rather than tell - users should experience the "aha" moment 
3. Remove non-essential steps - Find the shortest path for users to experience the "aha" moment

### Getting to know customers' needs
Answer the following questions: 

1. What do you need to know about users to give them a great experience?
2. What do users need to do in order to get value from your app?
3. What are the costs and benefits of adding friction to your onboarding?
4. How will you motivate users to complete onboarding?
5. At what point of the users' lifecycle must the onbaording be complete?
6. What actions must your user take regularly to drive growth and revenue?

### Onboarding never stops 
Onboarding is a continuous process of guiding people towards successful experiences

New users -> First use features -> Advanced use -> New feature -> Repeat 

1. EFOT - Expose features over time 
    Focus on increasing user interest with time and message impact -> What a feature is, What it does, and what it can the user do now with the feature
2. Anticipate next questions for enganged users - don't spoon feed the users. Instead, center information around the users "intent" 
3. Give help for lost and reluctant users
4. Help users form useful habits - Focus on making the product an important part of their everyday life 
5. Reativate dormant users 
6. Educate users about new possibilities 

### Know when to reset and when to optimize:

1. Good performance, little change in product -> *Optimize*
2. Good performance, lots of change -> *Redesign*
3. Little performance, lots of change -> *Redesign*
4. Little performane, little change -> *Redesign*

Instead of starting from the profitable view of a customer and reverse engineering outcomes, start with the *outcomes a customer wants* while onboarding one
